    <h2>Glendalough</h2>
    <article> It's worth the 1 hour and 16-minute drive from the city of Dublin, or roughly 3 hours by bus. It's a perfect day trip to see this scenic place, a free national park. Not only can you hike, but you can also swim in the upper lake, making it great for paddling in the summer. This historic area was founded by St. Kevin. You'll also have the option to briefly watch a video about St. Kevin before starting the hike. this location offers an amazing experience at every turn, whether you're looking for comfort in the embrace of nature, adventure along stretching trails, or a chance to enfold yourself in history of Ireland.</article>

    <p>St. Kevin at Glendalough is a renowned tourist destination, celebrated for its historic religious centers nestled amidst the stunning landscapes near Dublin. To make the most of your visit, I highly recommend dressing comfortably in activewear and ensuring you have close tennis shoes to help  walk the paths and trails with easier. Additionally, don't forget to bring along a hat and sunglasses to protect yourself from the sun's rays while exploring this scenic site.</p>
    <article> his place offers something for everyone to enjoy, with accessible pathways for those who use wheelchairs. One cool feature is that you're able to bring your dog, as it's a dog-friendly environment. However, please note that grills are not permitted</article>
