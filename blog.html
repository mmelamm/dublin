        <h3>Guest Lecture with Dr David Williams: </h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 10, 2024</time>
        <p>Engaging games is essential to encouraging engagement and meaningful experiences. It entails establishing objectives and tracking how users engage and relate to the game. Engagement can be measured along four main dimensions: performance, emotional response, skills, and participation/interaction. To guarantee that everyone can participate in games in an effective manner, accessibility must be improved. This entails changing components to meet various purposes. For example, in playgrounds, making sure that swings are high enough to allow for the inclusion of all kids is a great example of how important accessibility is to sustaining interest and achieving the inclusion goal and also Rugby that is big here use as an example who the ball can be used differently but when there is rules the dynamics changes.</p>

        <h3>The Ramen Bar</h3>
        <p>This restaurant offers delcious Japanese noodle soup dish that I encourage to try them out. Also to their flavorful offerings, they cater to a diverse clientele by providing a menu tailored to gluten-free dietary needs. Recently, I had the pleasure of indulging in their savory Salmon & Teriyaki rice bowl, accompanied by cherished friends and family, making for a truly memorable dining experience.</p>

        <h3>Glendalough</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-117">May 11, 2024</time>
        <p>Glendalough is quite beautiful, especially when you take a sunny nature walk there. I was able to see families enjoying the sunshine and excitedly planning their days as I walked around. Alongside this beautiful setting, I got to learn more about its interesting past. For example, the numerous monastic sites dotting the region offer intriguing windows into the past. And there are plenty of options available to satisfy hunger cravings. The only food truck there sells a delicious selection of goods for sale, including delicious coffee, filling sandwiches, and delicious desserts like ice cream.</p>
