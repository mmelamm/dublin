It entails establishing objectives and tracking how users engage and relate to the game. Engagement can be measured along four main dimensions: performance, emotional response, skills, and participation/interaction. To guarantee that everyone can participate in games in an effective manner, accessibility must be improved. This entails changing components to meet various purposes. For example, in playgrounds, making sure that swings are high enough to allow for the inclusion of all kids is a great example of how important accessibility is to sustaining interest and achieving the inclusion goal and also Rugby that is big here use as an example who the ball can be used differently but when there is rules the dynamics changes.</p>
